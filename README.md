# Rush

## What is the project all about?

Rush is a framework that helps you make static sites in a fast, clean, DRY and effortless way.

It is based on the Rails philosophy of convention over configuration. It is designed to be super easy to use for front-end developer to learn and start using immediately with a small learning curve. This was built by me as an internal tool to make the front end developers in the team more productive.
